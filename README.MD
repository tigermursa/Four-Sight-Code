Here are 15 problem questions that will help me strengthen my programming basics in C, C++, JavaScript, and Python. These problems cover essential concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, strings, file handling, and more.

### **Basic Programming Problems**

1. **Hello World with User Input** (Solved)
   Write a program that takes the user's name as input and prints "Hello, [Name]!".

2. **Sum of Two Numbers** (Solved)
   Write a program to take two numbers as input and output their sum.

3. **Factorial of a Number** (Solved)  
   Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using both iterative and recursive methods.

4. **Check Prime Number**  
   Write a program to check whether a given number is prime or not.

5. **Reverse a String**  
   Write a program to reverse a given string without using built-in reverse functions.

6. **Find the Largest Element in an Array**  
   Write a program to find the largest element in an array of integers.

7. **Fibonacci Series**  
   Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a given number of terms.

8. **Palindrome Check**  
   Write a program to check if a given string or number is a palindrome.

9. **Count Vowels and Consonants**  
   Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

10. **Simple Calculator**  
    Write a program to implement a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

### **Intermediate Programming Problems**

11. **Matrix Multiplication**  
    Write a program to multiply two matrices and display the result.

12. **File Handling: Read and Write**  
    Write a program to read data from a file, modify it (e.g., convert text to uppercase), and write it back to another file.

13. **Sorting Algorithms**  
    Implement at least two sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort and Quick Sort) to sort an array of integers.

14. **Search Algorithms**  
    Implement both linear search and binary search to find an element in an array.

15. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
    Create a class `Student` with attributes like `name`, `age`, and `grade`. Implement methods to display student details and update grades. (For C++ and Python)
